Getting Started
SERVER OR BACKEND
Firstly move to the server directory eg: cd server

Create a .env file The .env file will contain the following: i. MONGODB_URL = database connection string ii. JWT_SECRET_KEY = your secreate key iii. PORT = 8800 iv. AUTH_EMAIL= email address v. AUTH_PASSWORD= email access password vi. APP_URL = http://localhost:8800

Note: I used hotmail account to send verification email, so you can just create one because hotmail account is reliable in product and has no configuration.

Alos, change API_URL when you deploy your app else use localhost with the appropriate port number

Run npm install to install the packages

Run npm start to start the server

VIEWS FILE
In the view are the static html files to be use for email verfication and password reset.

This folder is a React App
navigate in the folder and install it dependencies
make changes to suit your preference and run build
copy the build folder into the view folder in the server folder
Override the existing one. NOTE: During deployment make sure you change the various links in the view file and build it again and replace the files in the view folder of the server folder.

CLINET SIDE
The client or frontend also has .env filde in the root folder. Create an environment variable of name REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_ID. This will store the cloudinary cloud name

This side also has and env file with REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_ID
